MagicBlock's Ephemeral Rollups technology is designed to provide web2-like performance to Solana developers and enable the creation of trustless, unstoppable games and applications on Solana. The company has now raised a total of $3 million in pre-seed funding to scale its engine for real-time onchain games and consumer applications on Solana. MagicBlock was in the Spring 2024 cohort of the a16z Crypto Startup Accelerator (CSX) program, and secured funding from a16z CSX in conjunction with its participation.

MagicBlock was founded to address the limitations of current onchain applications, which struggle with performance and scalability. In contrast to Ethereum Layer 2 solutions, which often introduce fragmentation and a poor user experience due to liquidity fragmentation and loss of composability, MagicBlock's Ephemeral Rollups function more like a coprocessor or an extension of Solana. Thanks to the Solana's Virtual Machine (SVM) native separation of state and logic, developers can move only part of the state to an Ephemeral Rollup session while retaining the core programs on Solana, effectively creating a multi-threaded environment for their dapps. This design ensures seamless composability with Solana and real-time performance, making Ephemeral Rollups ideal not only for gaming but also for any other application requiring high-performance and composability.

MagicBlock’s unique approach enables developers to create unstoppable, trustless, and composable applications that can operate without traditional servers, while avoiding the clunky feeling of transaction lags.This funding marks a significant milestone in MagicBlock’s journey. With the new funding, MagicBlock aims to expand its team, developer outreach and technology development. This raise is a testament to the growing demand for truly decentralized, high-performance applications in the web3 industry.
