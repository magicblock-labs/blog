Today, we’re launching the first MagicBlock Quest: a multi-part experience that will begin in the MagicBlock community and evolve onchain, giving you new ways to explore and interact with the MagicBlock world.

We built MagicBlock to power real-time experiences that stay entirely within Solana — where your assets, tokens, and actions remain in one place without being split across chains or slowed down by bridges. No interruptions, no fragmentation, no extra steps. A fast, simple way to use the full power of Solana without needing to leave it behind.

Whether you are playing a game, placing a trade, or interacting with a smart contract, everything happens in real time, with instant transactions and no lag. You get the speed and responsiveness you expect from everyday apps combined with the transparency, control, and freedom that only decentralized systems can offer.

This MagicBlock Quest is your invitation to see that vision in action. You will engage across different spaces, from community channels and creative challenges to live products and partner protocols. Whether you are contributing socially, creatively, or onchain, every step gives you a better sense of what MagicBlock enables and where it is going.

## What to Expect

**Phase 1: Social Sync** The first phase is off-chain. You will dive into challenges that immerse you in the MagicBlock world, from sharing insights to decoding lore to engaging with educational content and other community members.

These early social quests are more than a starting point. They will also feed into future progression, acting as a booster for later stages of the quest. The more you participate now, the more value your future quests will earn as things evolve.

**Phase 2: Onchain Unlocks** In the second phase, things go onchain. You’ll interact with the world of MagicBlock through real-time transactions, product experiences, and partner integrations — FlashTrade, ZeeBit, and SuperSize among them. These onchain actions help model the future of real-time gaming and finance.

The more you engage, the more you unlock.

## How to Join

We’re opening up the first phase on the 15th of April. To join the quest:
