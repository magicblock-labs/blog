The V0.1 of the BOLT engine is live. Bolt is a high performance and composable game engine that simplifies the development of games that are open, unstoppable and permissionlessly extendable/moddable. The design of BOLT includes an SVM-compatible acceleration layer that elevates the performance of fully onchain games on par with traditional multiplayer game server, without compromising the composability of Solana’s global state. In this early release we are going through the BOLT CLI and ECS, addressing the recents changes and explaining how to start building the first instance of an onchain world on Solana. ✨

## The ECS pattern

While Bolt isn't exclusively an Entity Component System (ECS) framework, it encourages the use of this powerful design pattern to enhance composability. ECS is a way of organizing code and data that lets you build games that are modular and easier to extend, which is one of the main benefits of fully onchain games. As the name suggests, in an ECS we have: 

- Entities which represent the objects of the game world. They are unique identifiers that don't hold any data or behaviour, but simply serve as containers
- Components are raw data structure that can be “attached” to entities
- System performs the game logic or behaviour by acting upon entities that hold components

This separation of concerns enables highly flexible, modular and scalable systems. You can explore all the benefits of the ECS pattern [here](https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq?tab=readme-ov-file#what-is-ecs. ).

## BOLT cli

The BOLT CLI is an extension of the Anchor framework. It includes all the features of the popular solana development framework, plus a superset of functionalities, such as creating world instances, components and systems. 

### Install BOLT

```bash
npm install @magicblock-labs/bolt-cli
```

You can verify the installation with:

```bash
bolt -h
```

Which will list all the available commands.

Initialize your first project. Run:

```bash
bolt init <new-workspace-name>
```

### Components

The example in the `programs-ecs/components` folder defines a `Position` component containing x, y, z coordinates. Remember that components are plain data structures that contain data relevant to a specific attribute of an entity. They don't contain any logic or methods. 

```rust
use bolt_lang::*;

declare_id!("Fn1JzzEdyb55fsyduWS94mYHizGhJZuhvjX6DVvrmGbQ");

#[component]
#[derive(Copy)]
pub struct Position {
    pub x: i64,
    pub y: i64,
    pub z: i64,
}
```

The **#[component]** macro is taking care of all the underlying Solana boilerplate. You don’t have to understand how Solana accounts work or how to allocate bytes or anything else other than the data itself.

Components are themselves programs deployed onchain. 

```rust
declare_id!("Fn1JzzEdyb55fsyduWS94mYHizGhJZuhvjX6DVvrmGbQ");
```
simply defines the unique address of the Position component above. 

### Systems

Systems contain the logic that manipulates components. A system will typically operate on all entities that have a specific set of components. The **Movement** system encapsulates the logic for updating the **Position** component.

```rust
use bolt_lang::*;
use component_position::Position;

declare_id!("FSa6qoJXFBR3a7ThQkTAMrC15p6NkchPEjBdd4n6dXxA");

#[system]
pub mod system_movement {

    pub fn execute(ctx: Context<Components>, args_p: Vec<u8>) -> Result<Components> {
        let position = &mut ctx.accounts.position;
        position.x += 1;
        Ok(ctx.accounts)
    }

    #[system_input]
    pub struct Components {
        pub position: Position,
    }
}
```

Each system implements an execute instruction, that will take care of applying the system's logic on an arbitrary number of components. 

The struct marked with the #[system_input] macro, specifies the bundle of components that the system will receive as input.

The execute instruction returns the modified components, which the world programs will update in the data structures after checking permissions and business logic.

### Putting it to work with the World Program

Now that we have the first component and system, let’s create a game instance with the World Program from the TypeScript SDK. The SDK provides a convenient interface and methods for interacting with bolt.

#### Installation
To install the bolt sdk, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @magicblock-labs/bolt-sdk --save-dev 
```

The World Program is the entrypoint for creating world instances, entities, attaching components, and executing systems. 


##### Create a world instance

```ts
const world = await World.fromAccountAddress(provider.connection, worldPda);
const entityId = new anchor.BN(world.entities);
entityPda = FindEntityPda(worldId, entityId);

let createEntityIx = createAddEntityInstruction({
    world: worldPda,
    payer: provider.wallet.publicKey,
    entity: entityPda,
});
const tx = new anchor.web3.Transaction().add(createEntityIx);
await provider.sendAndConfirm(tx);
```

###### Add a new entity

```ts
const world = await World.fromAccountAddress(provider.connection, worldPda);
const entityId = new anchor.BN(world.entities);
entityPda = FindEntityPda(worldId, entityId);

let createEntityIx = createAddEntityInstruction({
    world: worldPda,
    payer: provider.wallet.publicKey,
    entity: entityPda,
});
const tx = new anchor.web3.Transaction().add(createEntityIx);
await provider.sendAndConfirm(tx);
```

##### Attach the Position component to the the entity

```ts
const positionComponentPda = FindComponentPda(positionComponent.programId, entityPda, "");
let initComponentIx = createInitializeComponentInstruction({
    payer: provider.wallet.publicKey,
    entity: entityPda,
    data: positionComponentPda,
    componentProgram: positionComponent.programId,
});
const tx = new anchor.web3.Transaction().add(initComponentIx);
await provider.sendAndConfirm(tx);
```

##### Execute the movement system on the position Component

```ts
let applySystemIx = createApplyInstruction({
    componentProgram: positionComponent.programId,
    boltSystem: systemMovement.programId,
    boltComponent: positionComponentPda,
});
const tx = new anchor.web3.Transaction().add(applySystemIx);
await provider.sendAndConfirm(tx);
```

We have introduced the BOLT ECS, a pattern that enables game developers to create highly modular and composable games. 
Entities serve as containers for various components (raw data structure) allowing for dynamic customization without altering the underlying codebase. Systems interact with these components, infusing logic and behavior into the game entities. This separation of concerns not only simplifies the development process but also enhances the ability to extend and modify games post-launch. 

```rust
#[system]
pub mod system_apply_velocity {

    pub fn execute(ctx: Context<Components>, _args: Vec<u8>) -> Result<Components> {
        ctx.accounts.position.x += ctx.accounts.velocity.x;
        Ok(ctx.accounts)
    }

    #[system_input]
    pub struct Components {
        pub position: Position,
        pub velocity: Velocity,	
    }
}
```
