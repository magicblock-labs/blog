Today, we’re excited to announce a strategic partnership between MagicBlock and Pyth to bring 1ms price feeds to all Solana dApps. By combining MagicBlock’s high-performance network infrastructure with Pyth Lazer’s financial data feeds, we are unlocking new possibilities for institutional-grade DeFi applications that demand speed, accuracy, and deep liquidity.

At MagicBlock, our mission is to empower developers with the fastest, most scalable execution environments in Web3. Pyth Lazer’s high-fidelity, real-time data feeds provide an essential component for DeFi applications, ensuring that traders and protocols have access to the best available market data without relying on centralized sources.

> “MagicBlock’s ephemeral rollups enable us to deliver the lowest-latency, high-performance trading experiences, while Pyth Lazer ensures that our partners have the most accurate real-time data. Together, we’re eliminating the barriers to high-performance DeFi and we are paving the way for institutional-grade products.” – Andrea Fortugno, Co-Founder of MagicBlock

## Revolutionizing On-Chain Finance

Latency and unreliable data sources are two of the biggest challenges facing decentralized finance. DeFi protocols require execution speeds comparable to traditional finance while maintaining transparency and security. By integrating with Pyth Lazer, MagicBlock delivers:

- **Real-Time Price Data**: 1ms price feed and Ephemeral Node colocation ensure that financial data remains as granular as possible
- **Seamless Composability**: Builders can integrate Pyth Lazer’s data feeds into MagicBlock-powered applications without additional bridges or intermediaries.
- **Scalability for Institutional Use**: MagicBlock’s elastic transaction processing enables scalable DeFi applications to support institutional-grade trading volumes.

## A Shared Vision for the Future of DeFi

MagicBlock and Pyth share a vision of a decentralized financial ecosystem that rivals the speed and reliability of traditional markets. With this partnership, we’re equipping builders with:

- **Reliable, decentralized financial data** for trading apps, spot and derivatives protocols.
- **Optimized transaction execution** that scales dynamically to meet network demand.
- **Security, verifiability and transparency** of fully onchain apps built on Solana

> "Pyth Lazer's integration with MagicBlock represents a breakthrough for DeFi infrastructure. By combining Pyth Lazer's millisecond-latency price feeds with MagicBlock's ultra-fast execution environment, Solana developers have the tools to build apps that match the performance of traditional markets and have the potential to create the next generation of finance." -- Abhimanyu Bansal, Head of BD at Douro Labs

This collaboration is a call to DeFi builders everywhere: the future of finance is real-time, data-driven, and unstoppable. With MagicBlock and Pyth, the next generation of decentralized financial applications is here.
