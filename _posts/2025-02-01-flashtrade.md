Today, we’re thrilled to announce a transformative partnership with [Flash Trade](https://www.flash.trade/), Solana's leading asset-backed perpetuals exchange. Together, we’re setting a new standard for DeFi, delivering lightning-fast trading experiences that redefine the boundaries of speed and composability.
At MagicBlock, we empower builders to create without compromise—enabling performance that rivals traditional finance while embracing the trustless, decentralized ethos of Web3. By joining forces with Flash Trade, we’re unlocking the potential for a Binance-like exchange built entirely on Solana!

> “MagicBlock’s cutting-edge network infrastructure gives us the power to deliver on our vision: a CEXY trading experience that matches the speed of Web2 exchanges while staying true to the decentralized principles we believe in.” – [Anas](https://x.com/allinbitcoin_), Co-Founder of Flash Trade.

MagicBlock Ephemeral Rollups technology empowers Flash Trade to deliver:

- **Real-Time UX**: Sub-50ms latency for a trading experience that feels as intuitive as any Web2 platform.

With MagicBlock’s real-time network powering Flash Trade, high-frequency traders and institutional players alike can experience decentralized trading that meets the performance and expectations of centralized solutions.

Together with the team at Flash Trade, we share a bold vision: **to make decentralized finance as fast as centralized exchanges**. By overcoming fragmentations and scalability challenges, we’re enabling builders to dream bigger and achieve more.
With our real-time network, dynamic co-location, and cutting-edge runtime extensions, MagicBlock ensures that DeFi developers can build experiences that are as reliable as they are groundbreaking.

## Equipping Builders for What’s Next

**What this means for builders**:
