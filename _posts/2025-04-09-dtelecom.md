At MagicBlock, we're building a real-time engine for decentralized applications on Solana. Our cutting-edge ephemeral rollup technology delivers low latency, ultra-cheap fees with dedicated blockspace and, and elastic scalability, all while preserving composability with Solana's ecosystem. Today, we're excited to announce our partnership with [dTelecom](https://www.dtelecom.org/) — a perfect use case for our technology that demonstrates its real-world impact.

## A Perfect Match: Real-Time Performance Meets Decentralized Communication

dTelecom is creating a fully decentralized alternative to services like LiveKit and Agora, where anyone can become a bandwidth provider in a permissionless network. Their platform requires exactly what MagicBlock excels at delivering:

- **Sub-50ms latency** essential for VPN and real-time communication
- **Seamless Solana integration** without liquidity fragmentation
- **Ultra-cheap fees** thanks to dedicated blockspace and transactions batching
- **Dynamic scaling** to handle unpredictable global usage patterns
- **Gas abstraction** for frictionless user experiences

> "We founded dTelecom with a simple but powerful vision: communication infrastructure should be as open, resilient, and accessible as the internet itself," says Vadim Filimonov, Co-founder at dTelecom. "Finding the right technical partner was crucial to delivering on this promise. MagicBlock's unique approach to scaling Solana makes them not just a vendor, but a foundational pillar of our infrastructure strategy."

## Why This Partnership Matters

Building real-time, low-latency applications on the blockchain has historically forced difficult trade-offs between performance and decentralization. With MagicBlock's technology, dTelecom can deliver:

- **A Web2-level, seamless experience** with truly private, censorship-resistant communication.
- **A sustainable economic model** for node operators through instant, on-demand ephemeral rollups
- **Intuitive developer tools** that don't sacrifice user experience

> "This is a really exciting case where Ephemeral Rollups can help the unit economics of an ambitious network like dTelecom, aside from pure performance," says Andrea Fortugno, Co-founder at MagicBlock. "Their vision for decentralized communication aligns perfectly with our capabilities, and we're proud to provide the technology that helps make their ambitious roadmap possible."

## Reimagining Communications Infrastructure

dTelecom's vision goes beyond just another communication tool — they're building the foundation for truly censorship-resistant, private internet access through a comprehensive suite of tools including dVPN and real-time communication SDKs.

For their diverse ecosystem of bandwidth providers, privacy-conscious users, and developers, MagicBlock provides the invisible but essential infrastructure layer that ensures their platform can compete with centralized alternatives on performance while maintaining all the benefits of decentralization.

> "We evaluated numerous scaling solutions, but only MagicBlock offered what we truly needed—real performance without sacrificing the principles that matter to us," continues Filimonov. "Their technology isn't just complementary to our vision; it's essential to delivering what we've promised our users and developers."

## What's Next

As dTelecom expands its SDKs, node operator program, and enterprise integrations, MagicBlock will scale alongside them—providing the performance foundation that makes true decentralized communication possible.

This partnership opens a new chapter for both teams and the wider Solana ecosystem, demonstrating that with the right infrastructure, decentralized applications can truly compete with—and exceed—their centralized counterparts.

Real-time. Reliable. Unstoppable. This is the future of communication we're building together.
